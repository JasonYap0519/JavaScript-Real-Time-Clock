# JavaScript-Real-Time-Clock
A clock that is built under JavaScript which runs in real time. Uses CSS to style the clock's design. The reason I built this project is because I was inspired by a YouTube
video that demonstrates a real time clock. Besides, I wanted to apply the concepts of <strong>Date object</strong> that I learned from my Javascript Udemy course.
